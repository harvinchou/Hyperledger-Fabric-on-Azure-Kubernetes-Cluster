# Introduction 
This repo uses Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) Deployer to automate the deployment and configuration of the blockchain environment. HLF Deployer uses Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template) to deploy related resources such as orderer and peer in the Hyperledger Fabric network. This is to standardize and accelerate the deployment of Hyperledger Fabric in Azure China.
